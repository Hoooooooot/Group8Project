## Installing NPM

npm is a package manager for node.js. It's probably important.
```
npm install
```
## Initialize project

Creates a server.js file. Not sure if you need to do this.
```
npm -y
```

## Install expresss

Express is a package that you install with npm. It's a "popular, lightweight, and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for building web applications and APIs. It is designed to be minimalistic, allowing developers to easily create robust and scalable applications." (google.com AI answer)
```
npm install express
```

and now you have the template website! You can now type in the terminal 
```
node server.js
```
and it should run the template!

Will add more to this with better explanations hopefully.
